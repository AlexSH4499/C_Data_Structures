# C_Data_Structures
<p>
  A small project to help me reinforce previously learned concepts like Data Structures and direct memory manipulation.
  This is intended to mark my progress as an engineering student and test my current abilities to their maximum potential.

## Criteria
- Styling (naming conventions, simplicity)
- Modularity (decoupled methods and structures)
- Efficiency (space and time)
